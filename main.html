    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

	<p>
    Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. An algorithm with low time complexity is considered more efficient and better suited for handling large inputs.
  </p>
	
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run as a function of the input size. It is commonly expressed using notations like O(n), where 'n' represents the input size.
